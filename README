libBarcodes aggregates three ways of barcode scanning (with 3rd party components
as well):

 * iOS system approach (iOS7+)
 * ZXing (https://github.com/TheLevelUp/ZXingObjC ; ZXingObjC port)
 * ZBar (http://zbar.sourceforge.net ; curtsy to ultrafast scanning library ever)

libBarcodes aggregates several ways of barcode generating (with 3rd party components
as well):

 * iOS system approach (iOS7+, and iOS8+ or iOS9+ for some symbology)
 * ZXing (https://github.com/TheLevelUp/ZXingObjC ; ZXingObjC port)
 * ZInt (http://www.zint.org.uk)
 * qrencode (stand-alone QR generator, http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/)
 * aztecgen (stand-alone Aztec generator, http://aztecgen.sourceforge.net/)

Building:

  cd barcodes/core
  ./build.sh [cfg]

  where cfg is set of
    system  - with system scanner/generator (iOS7+)
    zxing   - with ZXing scanner/generator
    zbar    - with ZBar scanner
    zint    - with Zint generator
    qr      - with qrencode generator
    aztec   - with aztecgen generator
    bitcode - disable bitcode stripping
    debug   - disable debug info stripping
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using:

  see barcodes/example for sample project

Basically you need to build library and copy it with headers to your project, so 
required files are:

  barcodes/core/libbarcodes.a
  barcodes/core/include/UMBarcodeGenerator.h (for barcodes generating)
  barcodes/core/include/UMBarcodeScanViewController.h (for barcodes scanning)
