libBarcodes â€” library which summarises several efforts of the scanning and
generating of barcodes for iOS under the unified single umbrella controller

Some portions of scan controller are acknowledged from CardIO library, by the courtesy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libBarcodes aggregates three ways of barcode scanning with 3rd party components:

 * iOS system approach (iOS7+)
 * ZXing (https://github.com/TheLevelUp/ZXingObjC ; ZXingObjC port)
 * ZBar (http://zbar.sourceforge.net ; curtsy to ultrafast scanning library ever)

libBarcodes uses ZXingObjC to generate barcodes in default build configuration. Build
configuration without ZXingObjC uses aztecgen (http://aztecgen.sourceforge.net/) and
qrencode (http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building:
  
  cd barcodes/core
  ./build.sh [cfg]
  
  where cfg is
    all     - build with all scanners (default)
    no-zbar - build without zbar scanner
    system  - build only with system scanner (iOS7+)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using:

  see barcodes/example for sample project

Basically you need to build library and copy it with headers to your project, so required
files are:

  barcodes/core/libbarcodes.a
  barcodes/core/include/UMBarcodeGenerator.h (for barcodes generating)
  barcodes/core/include/UMBarcodeScanViewController.h (for barcodes scanning)
